# init_tm4c123

Automatically generates initialization code in ARM Cortex-M Assembly language and in C for the TM4C123 based on which pins are inputs or outputs.
Currently does not support alternate functions, dealing with commit registers and pull up/down resistors, and more complicated functions.
